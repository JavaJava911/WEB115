				<h1>LYRICAL MARTIN</h1>
				<p>He was born in the woods* Torn from his home. Well, he was naked, And destined To be out on his own. And he waited in darkness, Hoping someone might see, From something so rough, What a treasure he'd be. Stronger than steel and wood. Seen me through the bad and good. And when I'm hanging by a string, Every little thing Is understood Between Martin and me. Well he's hollow in the middle From the shape that he's in. He's either filled up with music Or locked in his shell again. And it takes some fine tuning To make him come around, But he's a huge piece of me And I'll never put him down. Stronger than steel and wood. Seen me through the bad and good. And when I'm hanging by a string, Every little thing Is understood Between Martin and me. </p>
